# TIPS — Temporal Interview Profiling System
## Comprehensive Project Overview & Progress Report

### 1. What is TIPS?
**TIPS** is an automated interview analysis system designed to transform raw video interviews into actionable research data. It bridges the gap between **live WebRTC communication** and **deep behavioral analytics**.

The system follows a three-pillar architecture:
1.  **Record**: A browser-based interface for conducting and recording interviews.
2.  **Process**: A 6-stage backend pipeline that extract signals (audio/video), transcribes speech, and uses LLMs to score responses against Job Descriptions.
3.  **Visualize**: A research dashboard that provides temporal evidence, competency breakdowns, and performance trajectory.

### 2. Core Architecture
-   **Backend**: Python/FastAPI server with ML integration (WhisperX, MediaPipe, Librosa, LLMs).
-   **Frontend**: Single-Page Application (SPA) using vanilla JavaScript and Chart.js.
-   **Data Flow**: Recordings → Signal Extraction → Alignment → Q&A Pairing → Semantic Scoring → Unified Dashboard.

### 3. What has been done? (Unified Frontend Build)
We have just completed a major structural upgrade to consolidate the system into a **Unified Frontend Application**.

#### **A. Single-Page App (SPA) Migration**
-   Migrated from separate `dashboard/` and `web_ui/` directories to a cohesive `frontend/` directory.
-   Implemented a **professional sidebar layout** with dark mode aesthetics.
-   Created a custom hash-based router for seamless navigation between 6 distinct views.

#### **B. New Interview Control Center**
-   Built a dedicated **Interview Control** page integrated directly into the dashboard.
-   Enabled real-time monitoring of room states (Waiting/Recording).
-   Added deep links for Interviewer and Candidate roles.
-   Integrated a live recording history with one-click pipeline triggering.

#### **C. Enhanced Research Visuals**
-   **Session Hub**: New verdict banners, KPI cards, and competency radar charts.
-   **Temporal Evidence**: Multi-track timeline visualizing speech, Q&A blocks, and score segments.
-   **Analytics**: Five-tab chart interface for deep-dive behavioral analysis.
-   **Q&A Review**: Advanced transcript review with LLM reasoning and score-range filters.

#### **D. API-Powered Data Delivery**
-   Modified the FastAPI server to serve all pipeline outputs via high-performance JSON endpoints (`/api/output/all`).
-   Implemented **Auto-Loading** logic: the dashboard now detects and loads the latest session automatically.

### 4. Current Status & Next Steps
The code implementation is **100% complete**. We are currently in the final verification phase.

**Current Blocker**: Missing environment dependencies (`fastapi`, `aiortc`, etc.).

**Immediate Action Required**:
1.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```powershell
    pip install -r d:\AIProject\TIPS\web_ui\requirements-web.txt
    ```
2.  **Start the server**:
    ```powershell
    python d:\AIProject\TIPS\web_ui\server.py
    ```
3.  **Verify**: Access the unified app at `http://localhost:8000`.
